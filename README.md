#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, develppment, testing and maintanance of software applications. It drives innovation and technological advancements. It helps with efficiency, security, artficial inteligence and scalability in the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The invention of high level programming languages is one of the key milestones. This revolutionized software development by making it easier to write and maintain programs. Secondly, structured programming is another key milestone. It improved clarity, quality and developing speed of code. The agile methodology is also another key milestone. It focused on continuos feedback, rapid iteration and the ability to adapt to changes during development, improving both productivity and product quality.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning. This stage involves gathering requirements and defining the project scope, goals and timeline.
Requirements analysis. In this stage, detailed requirements are collected from stakeholders, focusing on what the software should do.
Design. In this phase, the system architecture and detailed design specifications are created.
Implementation. This is the phase where developers write the code according to design specifications.
Testing. The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix bugs or issues.
Deployment.The software is now deployed into the production environment.
Maintanance. The software is updated, improved or patched to fix bugs and handle new requirements or environmental changes.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The waterfall methodology is inflexible which makes it difficult to make changes, whilst the agile methodology is iterative and very flexible. The waterfall is appropriate to use when the scope and requirements are well understood and unlikely to change. Agile methodology is more appropriate when requirements are not clear or likely to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
The software developer role is designing, coding and maintaining software applications. He or she responsible for wrting clean, efficient and well documented code.
The role of the quality assurance engineer is to ensure quality, reliability and perfomance of through testing and validation. He or she is reponsible for testing and improvement.
The project manager oversees the project from initiation to completion and acts as a bridge between clients, stakeholders and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software applicationsthat provide comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development, whilst version control systems rae tools that track and manage  changes to a codebase over time. Visusal studio code(VS Code) is an example of IDEs whilst Git is an example of version control systems



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some of the challenegs faced by software engineers include dealing with unclear or changing requirements and managing complex codebases. Documentation can help new team members to understand codebase easily. There must be frequent communication with all stakeholders to clarify requirements and ensure alignment.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure that each part works perfectly. It helps with early bug detection.
Intergration verifies the interation between different components or modules of the software to ensure they work together as expected. This ensures smooth system intergration.
Sytem testing evaluates the complete and intergrated software to ensure that the system meets its requirements and behaves as expected. This ensures that all functional and non-functional requirements are met.
Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether the software meets the business requirements and is ready for release. This ensures user satisfaction

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting effective input prompts to guide the behaviour of AI models. It maximises model perfomance.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example of vague prompt is "Tell me about technology"
You can improve it by saying "Describe the impact of articial intelligence on modern tourism practices"
